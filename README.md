# The Wooden Pallet Saga

There is a wooden pallet in the back of my school, been there since about sophomore year<br>

The end goal: car

# DAY 0: PRELUDE
the creation of this repo + arduino

# DAY 1
I asked the school receptionist, who referred me to the assistant principal, who contacted the groundskeeper and custodian

# DAY 2
All clear from both parties: it's too heavy to carry by hand; allegedly, the principal will be contacted and asked if he can use his truck to drive my pallet home. 

# DAY 3
stay tuned
